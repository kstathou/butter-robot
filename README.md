# Rick and Morty Twitter bot

This bot is created using [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and Tweepy.

To run it, you will need a file named `twitter_credentials.py` that includes the following:

```python
consumer_key = 'MY_CONSUMER_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'MY_CONSUMER_SECRET'
access_token = 'MY_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'MY_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'
```
